## Phase II : Energy

So far so good.

Ms. Lovejoy in charge of _Customer Turnover_ always says 

> a short game is a good game

...especially when the players pay for every game started.

Now each player is allotted 100 __energy blocks__, which run down at a rate of 1 per second.  When the energy hits zero the game is over.

However, the _Player Gamification_ team thinks that it would be fun to allow players to __trade-in points__ for another 50 energy blocks, at a rate of 10 points for _Tortoises_ and 12 points for _hares_. 

Bob in the main _Game Engine Developers_ pod says that it's too difficult to store the number of times a player trades in for more time, but cheerfully says that it would be no problem to provide the total game time and let you "sort it out from there".

This can be shown now as:

| Character | Number Prizes | Game Time (s) | __Score__ |
|-----------|--------------:|--------------:|----------:|
| Tortoise  |            10 |          20   |      64.3 |
| Tortoise  |            10 |          99   |      64.3 |
| Tortoise  |            10 |         101   |      54.3 |
| Tortoise  |            10 |         151   |      44.3 |
| Hare      |            10 |          20   |      24.5 |
| Hare      |            10 |         151   |       0.5 |
