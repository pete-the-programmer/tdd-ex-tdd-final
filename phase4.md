## Phase IV : Time of Day Bonus

The product is just about to be released and the _Product Launch Tiger Team_ has reminded everyone that 
in the supplementary documentation kept in the business section of the CRM it states:
> every player that starts a game between the __11th of June 2018 at 9am__ and the __17 of July 2018 at 5pm__ (NZ Time) will get a bonus of _30 points_ at the start of the game.

Your mission is to add these bonus rules to the scoring calculator, remembering to check the boundaries either side of the bonus time window.

HINT: You may need to deal with the _DateTime_ static object that is embedded in the _GameContext_.
