## Phase III : Increasing Rewards

Kim, the co-leader of the _Player Experience_ group feels that everyone likes to get something for free.

The idea is that prizes reap a __larger reward__ at an ever increasing rate as the game goes on.  So after the first 7 prizes, a _Tortoise_ gets 9 points and a _Hare_ gets 4 points per prize.  After 14 prizes, a _Tortoise_ gets 10 points, and a _Hare_ gets 5 points.  An so on, increasing when every 7 prizes are attained.

The _Business Analysis_ team says that the change is "trivial" and didn't bother to make a truth table this time.  Perhaps, you could make one yourself?
